# Tests

A simple set of tests to help maintain sanity.

The tests themselves are written in Python and can be run using the [nose](
https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) tool.

Install with:

```bash
$ pip install nose
```

Run the following command from either the base directory or this one to perform
the tests:

```bash
$ nosetests
```
